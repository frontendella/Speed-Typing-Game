The game counts the amount of words typed in a given time.    


## About 

In the code you can set the amount of time you wanna the game to last (time remaining), text area is disabled when we are not playing the game, when the user clicks "Start" - text field automatically receives the focus and let the user start typing right away, when the time is out, the text area becomes disabled again and it gives the user the amount of words they were being able to type in a given time. The "Start" button becomes disabled when the game is currently running. In the project used: useState, useEffect, useRef and a custom hooks.
