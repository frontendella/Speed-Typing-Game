## About 

The text area is disabled when we are not playing the game. 

When the user clicks "Start" - text field automatically receives the focus and let the user start typing right away. 

When the time is out, the text area becomes disabled again and it gives the user the amount of words they were being able to type in a given time. 

The "Start" button becomes disabled when the game is currently running. In the project used: useState, useEffect, useRef and a custom hooks.
